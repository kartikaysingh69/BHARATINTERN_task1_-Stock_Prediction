## Introduction

The primary goal of this to demonstrate how LSTM neural networks can be used for predicting stock prices. The model takes historical stock price data as input and learns patterns to make future predictions.

## Dependencies

- Python 6.5.4
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-lstm.git

# Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the data directory.

2. Run the prediction script:
  eg.(python predict.py)
   
View the results and predictions.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is located in the data directory. Ensure your dataset is formatted appropriately for training.
